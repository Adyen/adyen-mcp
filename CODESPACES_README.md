2. **Navigate to `.vscode/mcp.json`**


3. **Replace `{ADYEN_API_KEY}` with your [Adyen API Key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials/#generate-api-key)**
**Note:** To run certain functionality (tools) in the mcp-server, you need a webservice user with the following roles: 
* Management API - Accounts Read
* Management API - Payment methods Read
* Checkout Webservice Role
* Merchant PAL Webservice Role

Adyen recommends creating a new webservice user and generating a new API key for the purpose of this application.
Only use the new userâ€™s API key for the MCP application and limit the roles to match the tools you'll be using. 


4. **Click start to run the MCP-server.**

   * **Alternatively**, you may also add your `ADYEN_API_KEY` (TEST) to [Codespaces](https://github.com/settings/codespaces/secrets/new. This securely injects the key into your Codespace environment:

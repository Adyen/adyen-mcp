## Adyen MCP Server

The Adyen Model Context Protocol server allows you to integrate with Adyen APIs through LLMs function calling utilizing various Clients. It currently supports the following tools:

1. CheckoutAPI - Sessions
   - Create a /sessions payment request
   - Get the status of a payment session
   - Get the available payment methods
2. CheckoutAPI - Payment Links
   - Create a payment link
   - Update a payment link
3. Modifications API - Cancel / Refund 
   - Cancels an authorized payment
   - Refunds a captured payment
4. Management API
   - Gets a list of merchant accounts for your company account


### Usage
To run to the MCP server via `npx` you can execute:

```
npx -y @adyen/mcp --tools=all --adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY --env=TEST
```

Optionally, if the environment is LIVE then you must also provide your Merchant URL, for example:

```
npx -y @adyen/mcp --adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY --env=LIVE --prefixurl=YOUR_PREFIX_URL
```

**Note:** To run certain functionality (tools) in the mcp-server, you need a webservice user with the following roles: 
* Management API - Accounts Read
* Management API - Payment methods Read
* Checkout Webservice Role
* Merchant PAL Webservice Role

Adyen recommends creating a new webservice user and generating a new API key for the purpose of this application.
Only use the new userâ€™s API key for the MCP application and limit the roles to match the tools you'll be using.

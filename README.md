   - Get the available payment methods
2. CheckoutAPI - Payment Links
   - Gets the status of a payment link
   - Create a payment link
   - Updates a payment link (force expiry of the link)
4. Modifications API - Cancel / Refund 
   - Cancels an authorized payment

5. Management API
   - Gets a list of merchant accounts for your company account


### Usage
1. Run to the MCP server via `npx`, command:

```
npx -y @adyen/mcp --adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY --env=TEST
```

_Optionally_, if the environment is LIVE then you must also provide your Merchant URL, for example:

```
npx -y @adyen/mcp --adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY --env=LIVE --livePrefix=YOUR_PREFIX_URL
```

2. Chat with the MCP server (in `Agent` mode) to allow it to perform actions.
   * _Note:_ You'll have to confirm the action after your prompt.


**Note:** To run certain functionality (tools) in the mcp-server, you need a webservice user with the following roles: 
* Management API - Accounts Read
* Management API - Payment methods Read
* Checkout Webservice Role
* Merchant PAL Webservice Role

Adyen recommends creating a new webservice user and generating a new API key for the purpose of this application.
Only use the new userâ€™s API key for the MCP application and limit the roles to match the tools you'll be using.

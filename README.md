### Usage
To run to the MCP server via `npx` you can execute:

```
npx -y @adyen/mcp --tools=all --adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY --env=TEST
```

Optionally, if the environment is LIVE then you must also provide your Merchant URL, for example:

```
npx -y @adyen/mcp --adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY --env=LIVE --prefixurl=YOUR_PREFIX_URL
```

To run the server, you need a webservice user with the following roles: 
* Management API - Accounts Read
* Management API - Payment methods Read
* Checkout Webservice Role
* Merchant PAL Webservice Role

Adyen recommends creating a new webservice user and generating a new API key for the purposes of this application.
Only use the new userâ€™s API key for the MCP application and limit the roles to match the tools you will be using.

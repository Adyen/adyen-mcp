**Note:** To run certain tools in the mcp-server, you need a webservice user with the following roles: 
* Management API - Accounts Read
* Management API - Payment methods Read
* Checkout Webservice Role
* Merchant PAL Webservice Role

_Adyen recommends creating a new webservice user and generating a new API key for the purposes of this application._
_Only use the new userâ€™s API key for the MCP application and limit the roles to match the tools you will be using. _


The MCP server should start, see indicator:
